## GitHub Overview

GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git (the version control system). Think of it as a social network for developers, or a central hub for all your code projects.

**Key things you can do with GitHub:**

* **Host Repositories:** Store your Git projects online, accessible from anywhere.
* **Collaboration:** Work with other developers on the same project seamlessly.
* **Version Control:** Easily track changes, revert to old versions, and manage different versions of your code.
* **Open Source:** Discover and contribute to open-source projects.
* **Project Management:** Use features like Issues, Projects, and Wikis to manage tasks and documentation.
* **Code Review:** Discuss and review code changes before they are merged.
* **Portfolio:** Showcase your coding projects to potential employers.

It's essentially a powerful tool that makes using Git much easier for teams and for sharing your work publicly.
